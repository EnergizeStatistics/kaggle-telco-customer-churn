# Customer Churn Prediction #
This repository hosts a report on my analysis on telephone company customer churn. 

## Executive Summary ##
The data is publicly available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn). The business goal is to develop focused customer retention programs. 

I studied customer attributes such as internet service type and monthly charges. My analysis makes recommendations at both service level and individual customer level. Business actions I recommend include investigating the quality of the fiber optic internet service and researching the profitability to offer discounts to high-paying customers as an individual customer retention intervention.
